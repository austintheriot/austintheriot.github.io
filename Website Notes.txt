TO DO: ////////////////////////////////////////////

Home: 
- add in start/stop animations (like traffic lights) with offset

About Me: 
- add in words and description
- animate tree leaves
- fix bark on tree

Extras:
- Animate words with GSAP's TextPlugin
- Skew perspective based on mouse position


General:
- animate scroll to with GSAP (plug in already registered at top)
- Mobile blurry svg issue
- Mobile 100vh resize issue
- Computer: window resizing issue: buildings do not respect new width, and so could obscure the bench when expanding window from small to large on the about section.

- change setTimeout to Promises (throughout)

- Take out <h1>s in <sections> & get rid of CSS section h1 {}
- Optimize Roboto font (get rid of every weight, etc.)
- Optimize script files (convert to npm modules, minimize with Webpack, optimize compatibility with Babel, etc.)

Super Extra: 
- Add in smooth scrolling animations--(not possible apparently??)
- Change color based on time of day
- Change weather based on current weather
